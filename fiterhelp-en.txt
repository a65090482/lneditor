Translator's Note: The original text does not point out the plural, but my translation level is not good, so there is little correction for the plural.

Text filtering (beta) functional description:

Rows contain functions, i.e. those that satisfy the criteria are displayed. Multiple conditions are separated by\n and will be displayed if one of them is satisfied.


Row exclusion function, i.e. excluding rows satisfying conditions. Multiple conditions are separated by\n and will be excluded as long as one of them is satisfied.

The inclusion judgment is carried out first and the exclusion judgment is carried out afterwards, so the exclusion condition plays a decisive role when both inclusion and exclusion are opened simultaneously.

Note: Filtering has an impact on import / export, and the rows in txt correspond to the filtered rows one by one.
